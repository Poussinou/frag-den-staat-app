# FragDenStaat App

This app is a frontend for [FragDenStaat.de](https://fragdenstaat.de/), a website to simplify the process of sending and managing FOI requests to German public bodies.

The app should include basic functionalities of the website such as browsing through requests, searching, and creating new requests.

It is been developed with [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) for Android and iOS.
